		<h1> Internet Privacy and Smart Home Devices</h1>
		<p id="caption"> by Matthew Choy - 12/3/18</p>

		<p><b>Digital Assistants – What happens with your data?</b></p>


		<p id="body">
		The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices ranging
		from vehicles to home appliances embedded with sensors and electronic
		circuitry which allows them to communicate to other IoT-enabled devices
		around it. Smart home devices such as the Google Home and Amazon Alexa
		are just a small subset of the Internet of Things. They aim to break
		down the barrier between human and computer by providing a hands-free
		way of interacting with the digital realm.
		</p>
		<p id="body">
        This blog post will explore the issues surrounding data security of
        smart home devices from the various perspectives of stakeholders - users
        , governments and technology companies. Some recommendations on how to
        protect yourself will be provided.
        </p>


		<p id="body">

	    For many people, digital assistant devices like the Google Home and
	    Amazon Alexa are extremely useful. The Google Home platform allows the
	    consumer to interface with over 1500 IoT-enabled devices, from home
	    security systems, cooking appliances and robotic vacuum cleaners into
	    one smart hub. Imagine being able to turn on your air conditioning before
	    you come home or turning on your oven on your way home.
	    </p>
	    <p id="body">
	    In today’s fast-paced society, having access to information instantaneously
	    allows you to quickly and efficiently make decisions. Google Home and
	    other smart home devices enable the user to seamlessly integrate with
	    other services such email and calendars through a hands-free interface.
	    Arguably, the Google Home’s most impressive feature is its ability to
	    answer your questions through the power of the internet.

        However, for the Google service to function, it must have an internet
        connection. This constant connection to external servers presents an
        opportunity for hackers to remotely gain access to powerful microphones
        and cameras in households worldwide, compromising your privacy. Hackers
        could even control smart door locks and break into your house!
        </p>
        <p id="body">
		From the perspective of governments, the data gathered from smart home
		devices and other digital devices can be collated with the help of other
		organisations into a highly detailed database. In early 2016, the US
		Intelligence Chief James Clapper acknowledged for the first time that
		agencies might use smart household devices to increase their surveillance
		capabilities.

		        ‘In the future, intelligence services might use the internet of
		        things for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location
		        tracking, and targeting for recruitment.’

		    presentation on the assessment of threats against the US.

		<p id="body">
		As representatives of the people, governments have the responsibility of
		protecting consumers. Rules and regulations regarding the use of the data
		collected from digital devices are lacking. Governments must undertake
		the great challenge of navigating the controversial aspect of data security.
		Do governments have the right to access personal information if it was for
		prosecuting criminals? Would it be acceptable if our voting preferences were
		accessed?

        </p>

        <p id="body">Technology companies such as Google and Amazon can utilise information gathered from smart home devices for their financial benefit. They can record conversations through the microphone without the user’s consent or knowledge. Combining this information with the data gathered from search queries, emails and other services allows Google to obtain an extremely detailed view of your interests and daily life. This information can be used to create targeted advertising profiles, utilised through the Google AdSense program or sold as big data to other companies. </p>
        <p id="body">Presently, consumers face two prevalent issues regarding smart home devices. There are no consumer laws preventing companies from altering the software within their products like Apple’s software update in December of last year. The company introduced a power management feature which claimed to prevent unexpected shutdowns in older devices. Unbeknownst to the user, the feature slowed down the processors of last-generation devices, motivating many consumers to purchase newer models. Although not malicious, this demonstrates the ease in which companies can change the software within their devices for both strategic and financial gain. </p>
        <p id="body">Another prominent consumer issue facing smart home devices are the laws surrounding what these devices can record. The question needs to be asked – What is happening to the information collected from these devices? Google has only said that it uses the information ‘mined’ for improving the quality of the service – does this mean selling users data for project funding? </p>
        <p id="body">Governments and users need to work together to benefit from the use of smart home devices while mitigating the risks associated. It is recommended that all users carefully read terms and conditions before agreeing to use them. If you are uncomfortable with any of the conditions stated, it is advisable to not use or purchase the device. Unknown to many, the EULA (End User License Agreement) can be changed without the user knowing. Therefore, it is a good practice to review the EULA on a regular basis to ensure that you and your data are not being exploited. </p>
        <p id="body">Users should be conscious of the security risks and concerns associated with purchasing a device. The use of a smart home device provides external access to powerful microphones and cameras amongst other things in your house, compromising your privacy.  Consumers should not purchase devices which contain features they are uncomfortable with or have concerns over the device’s security and privacy. </p>
        <p id="body">Installing an advertisement blocker will minimise the effects of targeted advertising on the user. Popular ad blockers, such as uBlock Origin and adBlock Plus use JavaScript to filter or remove advertising content on web pages by altering JavaScript and CSS properties.

        <p id="body">It is imperative that Governments and regulatory organisations consider the effects of digital exploitation and create regulations to protect users. The issues of information privacy and exploitation will only increase as technology advances. Governments should prioritise the needs of its citizens over that of large technology corporations. </p>
        <p id="body">Smart home devices such as the Google Home and Amazon Alexa successfully provide an intuitive interface between human and computer. However, with this convenience comes serious privacy and security issues. Consumers should be aware of the capabilities of the products they purchase and evaluate whether the benefits of such a product outweigh the risks associated. Governments and other organisations which regulate technology should safeguard their citizens instead of the capitalistic intentions of large organisations.  </p>
